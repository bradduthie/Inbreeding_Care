(A) Relationship between parental investment per offspring (<i>m</i>) and the number of identical-by-descent copies of a focal female's alleles that are inherited by its offspring (<i>ζ<sub>off</sub></i> for females that outbreed (solid curve) and females that inbreed with a first order relative (dashed curve). Tangent lines identify optimal parental investment, and their slopes define a female's inclusive fitness when outbreeding (solid line) and inbreeding with a first order relative (dashed line). (B) Relationship between the magnitude of inbreeding depression in offspring viability (<i>β</i>) and optimal parental investment (<i>m<sup>*</sup></i>) across four degrees of relatedness (<i>r</i>) between a focal female and the sire of her offspring. Across all <i>β</i> and <i>r</i> presented, <i>m<sub>min</sub>=1</i> and <i>c=1</i>.

Relationship between the magnitude of inbreeding depression (<i>β</i>) and a focal female's inclusive fitness (<i>γ</i>) across four degrees of relatedness (<i>r</i>) between a focal female and the sire of her offspring assuming that focal females (A) invest optimally given the degree to which they inbreed and (B) invest at the optimum for outbreeding.

Relationship between parental investment (<i>m</i>) and the number of identical-by-descent copies of a focal female's alleles that are present in its viable offspring (<i>ζ<sub>off</sub></i>) for females that are outbred (<i>f = 0</i>; solid upper curve) versus females that are inbred (<i>f = 1/4</i>; dot-dashed lower curve). Grey shading between the curves shows the difference in <i>ζ<sub>off</sub></i> between outbred and inbred females across different degrees of parental investment. Thin grey tangent lines for each curve identify optimal parental investment (<i>m<sup>*</sup></i>).

Assuming strict monogamy, the (A) relationship between parental investment (<i>m</i>) and the number of identical-by-descent copies of a focal female's alleles that are inherited by its viable offspring (<i>ζ<sub>off</sub></i>) for females that outbreed (<i>r=0</i>; solid curve) and females that inbreed with first order relatives (<i>r=1/2</i>; dashed curve). Tangent lines identify optimal parental investment (<i>m<sup>*</sup></i>), and their slopes (<i>γ<sup>*</sup></i>) define a female's inclusive fitness when outbreeding (solid line) and inbreeding (dashed line). (B) Relationship between the magnitude of inbreeding depression (<i>β</i>) and <i>m<sup>*</sup></i> across four degrees of relatedness (<i>r</i>) between a focal female and the sire of her offspring.

Assuming strict monogamy, the relationship between the magnitude of inbreeding depression (<i>β</i>) and a focal female's inclusive fitness (<i>γ</i>) across four degrees of relatedness (<i>r</i>) between a focal female and the sire of her offspring given that (A) focal females invest optimally given their degree of inbreeding, and (B) females invest at the optimum for outbreeding.
