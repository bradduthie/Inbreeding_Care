abstract = {Inbreeding depression - the reduced survival and fertility of offspring of related individuals - occurs in wild animal and plant populations as well as in humans, indicating that genetic variation in fitness traits exists in natural populations. Inbreeding depression is important in the evolution of outcrossing mating systems and, because intercrossing inbred strains improves yield (heterosis), which is important in crop breeding, the genetic basis of these effects has been debated since the early twentieth century. Classical genetic studies and modern molecular evolutionary approaches now suggest that inbreeding depression and heterosis are predominantly caused by the presence of recessive deleterious mutations in populations.},

abstract = {Models that investigate family conflicts over parental investment have generally ignored population structure above the level of the family. Here, we extend conventional models to assess the impact of spatial population structure and limited dispersal on the intensity and resolution of parent–offspring conflict. Although one might naively predict that limited dispersal should reduce parent–offspring conflict, due to increased local relatedness, we show that this is not necessarily the case. Parent–offspring conflict may actually become more intense when dispersal is limited because local competition among related young can reduce the cost of any decline in maternal productivity, favoring greater selfishness on the part of the offspring. We also investigate the impact of limited dispersal on the resolution of parent–offspring conflict when the young can solicit extra resources by means of costly begging. Our model predicts that begging will be more intense when dispersal is limited but that the impact of dispersal on size then depends on the effect of parental supply on offspring demand. When greater supply leads to reduced demand, we find that parental investment should be higher in more viscous populations. By contrast, when greater supply leads to greater demand, parental investment should be lower in more viscous populations.},

However, where the male maintains the same harem for several breeding seasons, or where there is promiscuity but both sexes contribute equally to parental care, conditions for conflict are equivalent to monogamy. ?? 1978.},

abstract = {Sexual conflict is a conflict between the evolutionary interests of individuals of the two sexes. The sexes can have different trait optima but this need not imply conflict if their optima can be attained simultaneously. Conflict requires an interaction between males and females (e.g. mating or parental care), such that the optimal outcomes for each sex cannot be achieved simultaneously. It is important to distinguish between battleground models, which define the parameter space for conflict and resolution models, which seek solutions for how conflicts are resolved. Overt behavioural conflict may or may not be manifest at resolution. Following Fisherian principles, an immediate (i.e. direct) benefit to a male that has a direct cost to his female partner can have an indirect benefit to the female via her male progeny. Female resistance to mating has been claimed to represent concurrence rather than conflict, due to female benefits via sons (males with low mating advantage are screened out by resistance). However, the weight of current evidence (both theoretical and empirical) supports sexual conflict for many cases. I review (i) conflicts over mate quality, encounters between males and females of genetically diverged subpopulations, mating rate and inbreeding, (ii) the special features of postcopulatory sexual conflict and (iii) some general features of importance for conflict resolution.},
