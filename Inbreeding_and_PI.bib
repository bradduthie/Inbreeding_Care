abstract = {The population genetics of Trivers (1974) concept of parent-offspring is examined for species in which the effects of the conflict are felt by future half-sibs, as in promiscuous mating systems in which the male shows no parental care. Whether or not a rare conflictor gene will spread in a non-conflictor population depends on f{\{}hook{\}}(m) {\textgreater} (m + 1) (0.5m + 1.5) for a dominant gene, and on f{\{}hook{\}}(m) {\textgreater} 1 4(m + 3) for a recessive gene; f(m) is the fitness gained by a conflictor relative to a non-conflictor offspring [f{\{}hook{\}}(m) {\textgreater}1], and m is the amount of parental investment taken by a conflictor relative to m = 1 for a non-conflictor. The ESS value for conflict (mo) in promiscuous species with zero male parental care has mo = f{\{}hook{\}}(mo) 4[ df{\{}hook{\}}(mo) dmo]. However, where the male maintains the same harem for several breeding seasons, or where there is promiscuity but both sexes contribute equally to parental care, conditions for conflict are equivalent to monogamy. ?? 1978.},

@article{Parker1978,
abstract = {Theoretical models for Trivers (1974) concept of parent-offspring conflict are examined for species in which the effects of the conflict are felt by full sibs. A rare conflictor gene will spread if f{\{}hook{\}}(m) {\textgreater} 1 2(m + 1), wheref{\{}hook{\}}(m) is the fitness gained by a conflictor relative to a non-conflictor offspring (f{\{}hook{\}}(m) {\textgreater}1), and m is the amount of parental investment taken by a conflictor relative to m = 1 for a non-conflictor. The range of m alleles which can spread against the parent optimum decreases as the cost to the parent increases until a point is reached where there is no conflict of evolutionary interests. There would be no polymorphism for conflictor: non-conflictor alleles unless special conditions prevail. The conflictor allele which spreads most rapidly as a rare mutant against the parental optimum is not an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS). The ESS for parent-offspring conflict in monogamous species has m0 = f{\{}hook{\}}(m0) 2[ df{\{}hook{\}}(m0) dm0]. The analytical solutions are confirmed throughout by simulations. ?? 1978.},
